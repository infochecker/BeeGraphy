# Welcome to BeeGraphy

Aiming to fill a global gap in the CAD industry BeeGraphy has created an [online node editor for 2D and 3D parametric modeling](https://app.beegraphy.com). By creating BeeGraphy Editor, we aimed to turn the design and modeling workflow into a faster, more feature-rich process giving the shortest way to the next era of art: PARAMETRIC.

We encourage the organization and construction of large-scale design projects by gathering teammates together in one place. The professionals can work together, see each other's changes in real-time, comment or edit the needed part of the design, as well as share the 3D view of the project with the client or manufacturer.
Cloud-based collaboration platform.

Creating a convenient environment for organizing projects of various designs, BeeGraphy also provides a cloud server for their storage, which allows you to access your files from anywhere, wherever there is an Internet connection.
